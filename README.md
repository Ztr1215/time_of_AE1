# time_of_AE1
here is my data of the AE1, one is the excel sheet and another folder is the screenshot. In the excel sheet, the data is in ascending order. The fastest one at the first line. I delete the numbers that were too far off. For each sort, I test fo 10 times.
NB There are five pages in my excel sheet.
